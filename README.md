## Lecturer: John Rowley

## Assignment Description
To enable learners to understand the concepts of complex java applications and apply the skills acquired to develop and test the project.
Assignment will be completed in 2 parts –specification and a GUI application (100%)
GUI application – week after semester end with weekly updates with updates on a project planning board (Trello, Github projects, github issues)

## Additional Information 
Virtual Global College (VGC) is an old college with 3 branches in Ireland. 
They currently run a paper-based (word files, excel files) system to manage the 3 branches.  
As a developer you have been assigned to design and implement an application to register and manage courses, students and faculty members across the branches.
This application should be able carry out the following tasks:
•	Registering of Students for courses and their ongoing attendance for courses
•	Managing Student contact and personal identifying information
•	Tracking of Academic Progress of students (results for assignments and exams)
•	Tracking Payment of fees – including partial payments
•	Tracking of Exams, Assignments and dates and results (uploading not required)

## Running the Project
MySQL and Intellij IDE are required to run the program.
1. Download the document oop_final.sql found inside the database folder.
2. Open the document in the IDE and run in the main class.

## Project Summary
This report is prepared to outline the progress of the software launch of “Virtual Global College (VGC)”. 
The team encountered challenges in the design and the programing of the software but managed to complete 87% of the project.

## Considerations
The main objective of this project was fulfilled, which was to create a “Virtual Global College (VGC)” software, the project has some unfinished parts, however, it allowed us to study in a more in-depth way the programming language and its interactions based on data. <br>
Java is one of the most popular and imperishable programming languages in the world of technology industry. This is the reason why Java developers are in a constant race to improve their skills. The motto of OOP is to bind the data and the functions together, so as to improve code stability and safety.
